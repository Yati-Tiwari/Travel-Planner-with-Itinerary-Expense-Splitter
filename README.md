# Travel-Planner-with-Itinerary-Expense-Splitter
Develop a collaborative travel application that combines itinerary management with a robust  expense splitter. The system should allow groups to build their schedule real-time, store  tickets/bookings, log shared expenses on the go, and calculate exactly "who owes who" with  the minimum number of transactions.
